cap110_skills.py - optional player skills above the native mastery cap

Port-only, not native. Preserves every native skill row and remaps imported
identities by codename, never by the later client's numeric id: the later
client renumbers group, chain-next and prerequisite references. New ranks
attach to the native mastery ladder through that mapping; a genuinely new
group gets a collision-free id. No mastery, effect or execution owner is
invented here.
